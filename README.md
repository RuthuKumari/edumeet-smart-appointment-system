# 🎓 EduMeet – Smart Teacher Appointment & Recommendation System

EduMeet is a **full-stack MERN application** integrated with a **Machine Learning microservice** that enables students to book appointments with teachers and receive **intelligent teacher recommendations** based on subject preferences and past booking history.

The system uses a **hybrid recommendation approach**:
- 🤖 **ML-based recommendations** (when historical data exists)
- 📏 **Rule-based recommendations** (fallback when ML data is unavailable)

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👨‍🎓 Student Features
- Secure authentication & authorization (JWT)
- Browse approved teachers
- Book, cancel, and view appointments
- Subject-based teacher recommendations
- Hybrid recommendation display (ML / Rule-based)
- Email notifications for bookings

### 👩‍🏫 Teacher Features
- Profile management
- Availability management
- Appointment handling

### 🤖 Recommendation System
- ML-based recommendation using **KNN**
- Rule-based fallback using MongoDB subject matching
- Automatic switch between ML and rule-based logic
- Seamless backend ↔ ML microservice communication

---

### 🧠 Hybrid Recommendation Logic (Important)

The recommendation system works as follows:

IF subject exists in previous appointment history
    → Use ML-based recommendation
ELSE
    → Use rule-based recommendation (MongoDB subject match)

---

## 🔍 Why Hybrid?
- ML requires historical data
- New subjects or new systems may lack data
- Rule-based logic ensures no empty results
- Improves reliability and user experience

## 📊 ML Model Details

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Features:
- Encoded Student ID
- Encoded Subject
- Training data: Derived from MongoDB appointments
- Output: Recommended Teacher IDs

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Sensitive files ignored via .gitignore

## 📌 Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Store teacher subjects as arrays
- Collaborative filtering
- Recommendation confidence score
- Docker deployment
- Cloud ML service hosting
